<h2> Bella is a "Fox Red" Labrador. “Fox Red” Labs are simply a variation of yellow, its shading controlled by pheomelanin,
    a pigment that's controlled by yet another two different sets of genes, A and C. 
    The “A gene” controls the production of the red color, and the “C gene” controls whether or 
    not it is fully expressed or diluted (:1)
</h2>

<h3> Since "Fox Red" Labs are still fairly rare to see, they are often highly sort after by Dog-breeders... and
    since she's such a beautiful girl, we did briefly loan her back to the breeder she came from, so she could have
    her own litter of puppies. Though once they were born, it was hard not to try & leave with all the puppies
